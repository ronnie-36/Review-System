# Decentralized Review System for Transparent and Accountable Governance
A decentralized review system for governance, which is more trustworthy and reliable than a centralized review system. It uses networks like Blockchain and IPFS to store the reviews immutably. The immutability helps us build trust among people on the reviews in our system, making our reviews visible to everyone and impossible to remove.
We used Solana Blockchain and IPFS to implement the Decentralized Review System. IPFS protocol is used for storing the reviews, and Solana stores the references to those reviews.
